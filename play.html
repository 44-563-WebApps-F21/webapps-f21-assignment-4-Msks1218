    <h3>AN IDEAL HUSBAND</h3>
    <h4>_Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.</h4>
    <p>
        <h6>LORD GORING</h6><p>My dear Robert, it’s a very awkward business, very awkward
        indeed.  You should have told your wife the whole thing.  Secrets from
        other people’s wives are a necessary luxury in modern life.  So, at
        least, I am always told at the club by people who are bald enough to know
        better.  But no man should have a secret from his own wife. She
        invariably finds it out. Women have a wonderful instinct about things.
        They can discover everything except the obvious.</p>
        
        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6><p>I couldn’t tell my wife.  When could I have
        told her?  Not last night. It would have made a life-long separation
        between us, and I would have lost the love of the one woman in the world
        I worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me.  Last
        night it would have been quite impossible.  She would have turned from me
        in horror . . in horror and in contempt.</p>
        
        <h6>LORD GORING</h6><p>Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?</p>
        
        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6><p>my wife is as perfect as all that.</p>
        
        <h6>GORING</h6><p>[_Taking off his left-hand glove_.]  What a pity! I beg
        your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that.  But if what you
        tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with
        Lady Chiltern.</p>
        
        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6><p>It would be quite useless.</p>
        
        <h6>GORING</h6><p>may I try?</p>
        
        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6><p>Yes,but nothing could make her alter her views.</p>
        
        <h6>GORING</h6><p>Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological experiment.</p>
        
        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6><p>All such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p>
        
        <h6>LORD GORING</h6><p>Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  If it wasn’t so,
        life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
        you should have told her years ago.</p>
        
        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6><p>When?  When we were engaged?  Do you think she
        would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
        such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
        a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?</p>
        
        <h6>LORD GORING</h6><p>[_Slowly_.]Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There
        is no doubt of that.</p>
        
        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6><p>[_Bitterly_.]  Men who every day do something of
        the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
        in their own lives.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING</h6><p>That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
        people’s secrets.  It distracts public attention from their own.</p>
        
        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6><p>And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did? NO one.</p>
        
        <h6>LORD GORING</h6><p>[_Looking at him steadily_.]  Except yourself, Robert.</p>
        
        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6><p>[_After a pause_.]  Of course I had private
        information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
        the day, and I acted on it.  Private information is practically the
        source of every large modern fortune.</p>
